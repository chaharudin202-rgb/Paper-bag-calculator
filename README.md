​🖋️ Background

​This web application was born from my 4 years of hands-on experience in the offset packaging industry. During my time in the field, I realized that the most critical yet challenging task is accurately calculating material usage and production costs.
​Calculating the "nampang" (nesting) on a plano sheet and estimating costs manually is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, which can lead to significant financial losses. I built this tool to bridge the gap between technical printing expertise and digital efficiency.

​🚀 Purpose & Vision

​The goal of this MVP is to:
​Accelerate the Quotation Process: Generate accurate price offerings for clients in seconds.
​Optimize Material Efficiency: Using a custom algorithm to determine the maximum pieces per plano sheet, reducing paper waste.
​Reduce Calculation Errors: Automating complex production variables to ensure every bid is profitable and precise.

​🛠️ Key Features

​Smart Plano Optimizer: Automatically calculates the best layout on a plano sheet, including 90° rotation support for maximum yield.
​2D Pattern Generator: Dynamically creates a technical drawing of the paper bag based on Length, Width, and Height.
​3D Mockup Preview: Interactive 3D visualization using Plotly to help clients visualize the final product.
​Comprehensive Cost Breakdown: Flexible management for paper costs, printing fees, and finishing touches.

​💻 Tech Stack

​Python (Core Logic)
​Streamlit (User Interface)
​Matplotlib & Plotly (2D & 3D Visualization)
